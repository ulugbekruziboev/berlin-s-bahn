S-Bahn Berlin project. It contains an interactive map of the history of the development of the Berlin S-Bahn network and some analysis behind the data.

The intention of the project is purely educational and thus non-commercial. 
I personally love the public transportation and this type I had the data and an interest to visualize it.
This readme would be updated often as I will have more thoughts to share.

The main file is S-Bahn_project.ipynb and can be viewed from the browser right away, Berlin_S_Bahn_stations_info.csv is the dataset and all the HTML files are the plots and the interactive map which are needed to be downloaded in order to see the contents.
