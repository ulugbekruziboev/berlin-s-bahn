Code and database dump# berlin-s-bahn
S-Bahn Berlin project. It contains an interactive map of the history of the development of the Berlin S-Bahn network and some analysis behind the data.

The intention of the project is purely educational and thus non-commercial. 
I personally love the public transportation and this type I had the data and an interest to visualize it.
This readme would be updated often as I will have more thoughts to share.
